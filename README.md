# Siyuan_Review
A review platform focusing on the culinary and scenic offerings within SJTUâ€™s campus using SpringBoot and MyBatis-Plus.
## Shining Points:
- Implemented Redis caching for store data and effectively resolved cache breakdown issues through techniques such as
mutex and cache expiration.
- Leveraged Redis to enable flash sales of products, effectively mitigating overselling issues using optimistic locking.
Integrated Lua scripts with message queues to achieve asynchronous flash sale processes.
- Conducted comprehensive stress tests using Jmeter to address concerns like cache penetration and one-person-one-order
scenarios.
